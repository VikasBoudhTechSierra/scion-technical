              <p>
                Demonstrate genuine interest in the role and company. Ask
                thoughtful questions about the position, team culture, and
                company goals. Encourage conversation by actively listening and
                engaging with the interviewer’s responses.

              <br />
              <p>
                Focus on demonstrating value. Save questions about compensation
                and benefits for later stages of the hiring process. Your
                priority is showcasing your skills and experience as they relate
                to the specific needs of the job.

              <br />
              <p>
                Prepare impactful examples. For each question, offer concrete
                examples from past projects, accomplishments, or challenging
                situations that highlight your relevant skills and
                problem-solving abilities. Ensure these examples align with the

                Be prepared for behavioral questions. Have a story ready of a
                difficult situation you faced and the valuable lesson you
                learned. Focus on your growth and resilience.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Stay relevant and concise. Avoid sharing irrelevant experiences
                or rambling about past roles that don’t directly connect to the
                current opportunity.
              </p>
              <br />
              <p>
                Articulate your skills confidently. Explain your qualifications
                clearly and connect them to the specific requirements of the
                job. Communicate your passion for the field and demonstrate your
                teamwork abilities.

                Remember, you’re presenting yourself as a valuable asset. Show
                genuine enthusiasm while maintaining a professional presence.
                Guide the conversation to highlight your strengths and why you
                are the ideal candidate for the position.
